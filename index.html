        <h1>Privacy policy for the Senior Source</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Shield Our Seniors app for Android!</p>
        <p>This app was developed through a collaboration between The Elder Financial Safety Center at The Senior Source of Dallas, a non-profit that serves aging adults; UNT Dallas College of Law; University of North Texas at Dallas School of Human Services; and Dallas County District Attorneyâ€™s Office. This app provides easy access to information, education, and training to anyone with frontline access to older adults. Abuse can be physical, financial, and emotional. Please use this app as a resource for information about the Texas penal code; Texas civil statutes and definitions; warning signs of abuse; and resources relating to aging individuals.</p>
        <p>As a responsible app developer, we take privacy very seriously. Privacy is our top priority.</p>
        <p>To the best of our knowledge and belief, we have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.</p>
        <p>If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently overlooked or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:app@theseniorsource.org">app@theseniorsource.org</a></p>
